# GarageInvoice
The GarageInvoice is a desktop and android app where auto shops can create and view invoices for the services provided while maintaining proper organization and accessibility using an online MySQL database. The main page allows customer data to be entered before proceeding to the options for services. An admin page was added to make quick changes to the invoices. On android, a similar invoice data collector is shown which can then be displayed and uploaded to the database in order to be accessed by both devices.
